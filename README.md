# Zomato-Project
This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant and order data using SQL to extract meaningful business insights. The goal is to understand customer ordering behavior, restaurant performance, cuisine popularity, revenue trends, and rating patterns.

# Project Overview
This project demonstrates my ability to tackle complex SQL problems in a business context. The goal was to analyze Zomato's customer and order data to derive meaningful insights, solve business problems, and provide actionable recommendations. The database includes information about customers, restaurants, orders, and deliveries.

# Project Structure
 > Database: zomato

 Tables:
 
 restaurants - Stores restaurant data.
 
 food - Contains food details.
 
 menu - menu data.
 
 orders - Records of customer orders.
 
 users - Details of users deliveries.

# Key SQL Tasks:
Data Import: Sample data was inserted into the database after tables were created.
Data Cleaning: Null values were handled, and data integrity was ensured.
Business Problem Solving: 20 advanced SQL queries solved specific business problems using the data. 


# Executive Summary
# Overview of Findings
The analysis uncovered significant insights regarding customer behavior, restaurant performance, and order trends. For a stakeholder in the marketing or operations department, three key takeaways are:

1.The peak ordering times occur between 18:00 and 20:00, indicating optimal hours for promotions.

2.High-value customers (who have spent more than 100K) represent a small but critical segment, contributing disproportionately to total revenue.

3.Non-delivered orders remain a challenge, especially for restaurants in major cities, where operational efficiencies need to be improved.

# Conclusion
This project showcases the use of SQL to solve real-world business problems for a food delivery company. Through detailed data analysis, insights were derived that can help optimize operations, improve customer retention, and increase restaurant revenue.
